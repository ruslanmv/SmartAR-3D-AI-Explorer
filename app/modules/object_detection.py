class ObjectDetection:
    """
    A simplified object detection module that uses a YOLO-like model 
    (provided by MLModelManager) to detect bounding boxes in camera frames.

    The actual detection logic depends on the type of model you load:
      - PyTorch (YOLOv5) approach
      - ONNXRuntime with a YOLO .onnx file
      - Any other custom model

    For demonstration, this code includes a STUB that returns a single detection
    for a "chair" bounding box.

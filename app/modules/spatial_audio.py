    Implements spatial (3D) audio rendering, typically with HRTFs or binaural audio techniques.
    This module is primarily for providing directional cues for users wearing AR glasses,
    especially if they are visually impaired.

    In a real production environment, you might:
      - Use OpenAL or FMOD or another audio engine that supports 3D positioning.
      - Load a Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) dataset for more accurate binaural rendering.
      - Continuously update the userâ€™s head orientation, re-rendering the audio scene accordingly.
